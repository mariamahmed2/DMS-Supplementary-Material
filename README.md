# IMX219 Camera Dataset

This dataset was collected during our work on the Driver Monitoring System (DMS) to evaluate its accuracy. It includes data for head pose (left, right, center, up, down), eye and mouth closure (opened and closed), as well as a modified true labeling version of the MPIIGaze open-source dataset for eye gaze. 

# Latex Files for the Book
This includes LaTeX files detailing the comprehensive procedure and steps for building the application. The book starts with the system software architecture design and continues through to the deployment on the BeagleBone AI-64 using the IMX219 Camera, culminating in the performance evaluation.
