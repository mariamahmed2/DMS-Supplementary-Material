# IMX219 Camera Dataset

This dataset was collected during our work on the Driver Monitoring System (DMS) to evaluate its accuracy. It includes data for head pose (left, right, center, up, down), eye and mouth closure (opened and closed), as well as a modified true labeling version of the MPIIGaze open-source dataset for eye gaze.
